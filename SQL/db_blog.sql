It would also mean a better world &ndash; more diverse voices would mean products and services that work for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a woman in tech, I am already swimming upstream when it comes to respect in the field.

(43, 13, 'Why thereâ€™s no such thing as a perfect vegan', '8fa9893f25.jpg', '2018-11-16', '<p>Eight years on, veganism still has me scratching my head. My commitment hasn&rsquo;t wavered, but the questions surrounding what is and isn&rsquo;t vegan continue to plague me on a weekly (and sometimes daily) basis. While many assume veganism is strictly about refusing to use animal products, for most vegans it is also about living a life that excludes all forms of animal exploitation. And with mainstream veganism firmly on the rise, the questions keep coming as we learn more about the agricultural price-tags of our choices. Of course, each new discovery is greeted with delight by many non-vegans, who revel in the notion that we&rsquo;ve been caught out. There is now even a website&nbsp;<a href=\"http://almondsarenotvegan.com/\">dedicated to almonds not being vegan</a>&nbsp;(more on this later).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As recently as last week, my &ldquo;nearly vegan&rdquo; mother passed on a concerned message from a close friend who felt it imperative that I know almonds (yep, them again) are emphatically not vegan. Cease the almond consumption immediately (that is, if they come from California). Oh, and don&rsquo;t forget avocados too &ndash; particularly if they&rsquo;re of the Mexican variety. Add dates to the list while you&rsquo;re at it &hellip; and what&rsquo;s the deal with figs again?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just non-vegans who want to catch us out. My brief foray into vegan chatrooms quickly made it clear that there was a competitive side to the vegan community.

(47, 15, 'Google Shows Off New Android Dev Tools', '6be3b0c73f.jpg', '2018-11-16', '<p><strong>G</strong>oogle announced support for a range of new Android tools for application developers, chief among them the creation of a new support category for foldable devices, at last week&#39;s Developers Summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After years of teasing and speculation, it finally looks as though foldable screen smartphones are headed to market. Google&#39;s dev announcement followed closely on the heels of Samsung&#39;s announcement at its own developer conference of a folding phone/tablet prototype with Infinity Flex Display.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Android tools will take advantage of the new display technology, which literally bends and folds, noted Stephanie Cuthbertson, director of product management at Google. The technology is based on two variations of screen design: two-screen devices and one-screen devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either way, the new devices will look like phones when folded, so they will fit into a pocket or purse. When unfolded, they will display screen continuity seamlessly. For example, as the device unfolds with an active image already in use, the image will transfer to the bigger screen without flutters or distortions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Official support from the Android development team means that folding phones are being taken seriously as a new type of device,&quot; said Brandon Ackroyd, head of customer insight at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.tigermobiles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tiger Mobiles</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Marketability Unknown</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Consumer interest in owning foldable devices is still an unknown factor. It might turn out that if they build them, no one will come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Google&#39;s new developer support augurs well for Samsung and other manufacturers working on foldable devices, Ackroyd does not think it means foldable phones are going to be the must-have product of the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Right now, I don&#39;t see the use case or any apparent advantages,&quot; he told LinuxInsider. &quot;What I do see, however, is a proof-of-concept of this type of foldable screen technology, and I think we&#39;re going to see many different products make use of this soon. Perhaps [it will become] the next-generation type wearable that fully wraps around your wrist.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foldable mobile devices are not guaranteed to be successful as the technology transitions from concept to reality, observed Charles King, principal analyst at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pund-it.com/\" onclick=\"window.open(\'http://www.pund-it.com/\'); return false;\">Pund-IT</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;In many ways, smartphone users are the world&#39;s largest community of lab rats, in the sense that so many are willing to follow wherever handset makers lead in terms of new features and functions,&quot; he told LinuxInsider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was not so long ago that oversized smartphones made by a few adventuresome vendors were dismissively called &quot;phablets,&quot; he recalled, but today, larger form factors dominate the high end of the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foldables could catch on among consumers who are tired of lugging around phones that resemble paperback books. Those consumers still want large displays for media consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It will be interesting to see whether that happens, or if buyers simply stick with the designs they know,&quot; said King.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Flexible Future</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the resources that are available today, manufacturers have a good shot at making foldable screen devices appealing to consumers, suggested Rob Webber, CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.moneysavingpro.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MoneySavingPro</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Futuristic-looking foldable smartphones have always been a dream concept, he noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Smartphones have evolved dramatically since they were first invented, especially their displays,&quot; Webber told LinuxInsider, recalling the stylus input before Apple introduced touchscreens that were able to react to the electrical impulses generated by the user&#39;s fingers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Now we&#39;re at a stage where edge-to-edge displays are the norm. Some could say that foldable displays are just the next rung on the ladder,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it&#39;s unlikely the new technology will be a simple transition, Webber added. It will face many obstacles before the technology advances. The key to the foldable mobile device being a success is hardware and software integration, which will take time for manufacturers to perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cost also might be an issue. With the continually rising prices of new smartphones, if foldable devices are going to cost significantly more, they may appeal only to a very niche market, Webber reasoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Having said that, I think we are currently at an exciting stage that marks the beginning of an emerging battle between manufacturers and the start of a very flexible future,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Potential Exploit and Failure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Money may not be the only cost factor consumers will face if foldable screens catch on. Smaller yet expanding devices may be more appealing to hackers than to consumers, warned Mike Banic, vice president of marketing at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vectra.ai/\" target=\"_blank\">Vectra</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of Web searches performed on a mobile device has been increasing steadily. New mobile technology that makes it easier to use mobile devices to create as well as consume information means that attackers will exploit the trend, he told LinuxInsider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the number of mobile vulnerabilities is highest on Android apps, largely due to its open source nature and the questionable security of third-party app stores, Banic said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Mechanicals could introduce a point of failure that may cause adoption to stumble,&quot; he noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Google Dev Support Wrapup</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Google&#39;s plan to bring more Android tools to app developers is part of an ongoing program. The Dev Summit announcements suggest the company has decided to take an aggressive approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new features will be rolled out to a number of developers who are considered &quot;partners.&quot; Availability then will expand further to devs before they eventually become accessible to all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is a solid group of announcements that most Android developers will welcome,&quot; said Pund-IT&#39;s King. &quot;At a time when smartphone market growth appears to have stalled, introducing support for new features and form factors could offer Android device makers what they need to make their products stand out from the crowd and attract customer interest.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Updates to Kotlin Programming Language</strong>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Kotlin is not a Google-developed language, but it is one that devs have favored. Last week,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jetbrains.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JetBrains</a>&nbsp;released the latest version of Kotlin, 1.3, which brings new language features, APIs, bug fixes and performance improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>It has become the fastest-growing language, in terms of the number of contributors on GitHub, and has been voted the second most-loved language on Stack Overflow.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>In Google&#39;s surveys, the more developers use Kotlin, the higher their satisfaction, according to Google&#39;s Cuthbertson.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Android Jetpack</strong>\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Google announced new Jetpack libraries, the next generation of tools and Android APIs to accelerate Android application development. It contains two new Architecture Component libraries: Navigation and Work Manager, that will move to Beta this month.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The Navigation Architecture Component offers a simplified way to implement Android&#39;s navigation principles in an application. Plus, the new Navigation Editor in Android Studio creates and edits navigation architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<hr /><a href=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/article_images/2018/85671_990x575.jpg\"><img alt=\"Jetpack Navigation Editor\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/article_images/2018/85671_620x360-small.jpg\" /></a>\r\n\r\n	<p>Jetpack Navigation Editor</p>\r\n\r\n	<hr />\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>This eliminates navigation boilerplate while adding atomic navigation operations with easier animated transitions and more. WorkManager makes it easy to perform background tasks in the most efficient manner, choosing the most appropriate solution based on the application state and device API level.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Slices</strong>\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Google moves Android Slices to public Search experiments. Slices is a new way to bring users to an app. It works like a mini snippet of an app that surfaces content and actions.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>&quot;Aside from the foldable announcement, the most interesting angle was the further development of Google Slices. This new concept allows Android apps to push relevant components and features of their apps into other places, such as the Google Search,&quot; said Tiger Mobiles&#39; Ackroyd.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>By loading a small part of an app right from the search results, users can get a near-native app experience without actually fully opening the app, he said. For example, if you google &#39;What is the Tesla stock price?&#39; and you have a stocks app installed, that app can use a &#39;slice&#39; to give you the info.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Google announced the concept of Slices with Android 9 Pie. This new paradigm allows apps to surface relevant components and features in natural places, like Google Search.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>This month, Google will make Slices available as part of a public Early Access Program with partners. Google also will begin experiments in the Search app to surface various Slices when relevant.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Android Studio</strong>\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Android Studio, Google&#39;s official IDE for Android development, has a new focus on productivity, build speed, quality and fundamentals.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Google launched Android Studio 3.3 beta 3 last week. Upcoming releases will add a strong focus on quality and fundamentals. Google also announced the development of Android Studio on Chrome OS early next year.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Android App Bundles and Dynamic Features</strong>\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The Android App Bundle is the new publishing format that serves only the code and resources users need to run an app on their specific devices. It will reduce app sizes with an average of 35-40 percent savings compared to a universal APK.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The app bundle now supports uncompressed native libraries. With no additional developer work needed, the app bundle now makes apps using native libraries an average of 8 percent smaller to download and 16 percent smaller on disk on M+ devices.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>In-app Updates API</strong>\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Google is giving devs more controls to ensure that users run the latest and greatest version of their apps. In-app Updates API will give devs two options.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The first is a full-screen experience for critical updates when you expect the user to want the update to be applied immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The second option is a flexible update. It lets users continue with the existing installed version while the update is downloaded. The developer can use it to ensure that users have the most up-to-date version, because the app can be pushed to install in the background using the automatic updates feature.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Instant Discovery</strong>\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Google hopes to make instant apps easier to adopt. The company recently made the use of Web URLs optional, so devs can send their existing Play Store deep link traffic to their instant experience if it is available.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Also, Google raised the instant app size limit to 10 MB for the Try Now button on the Play Store and Web banners for greater adoption ease.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 2, 6);

The incident initially sparked concerns that it might have been a malicious hijacking attempt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mishap made Google&#39;s search and other services unavailable to many users intermittently. It caused problems for Spotify, Google cloud customers, G-Suite users and Youtube viewers, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem started when the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mainone.net/\" target=\"_blank\">MainOne Cable Company</a>&nbsp;in Lagos, Nigeria, improperly updated tables in the Internet&#39;s global routing system to declare that its autonomous system was the proper path to reach 212 IP prefixes belonging to Google. China Telecom shortly thereafter improperly accepted the route and announced it worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That move, in turn, caused Russia-based Transtelecom and other large service providers to follow the route. The misdirected traffic led to China Telecom, the Chinese government-owned provider that recently was caught improperly routing Western carriers&#39; traffic through mainland China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re aware that a portion of Internet traffic was affected by incorrect routing of IP addresses, and access to some Google services was impacted. The root cause of the issue was external to Google, and there was no compromise of Google services,&quot; a Google spokesperson told TechNewsWorld via company rep Lindsay Hart.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.technewsworld.com/adsys/count/10027/?nm=a-nmg_tnw_160-1&amp;ENN_rnd=15423094969252&amp;ign=0/ign.gif\" style=\"height:0px; width:0px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Questionable Explanation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Google is adamant that the mishap resulted from a prefix leak in configuring BGP, the Internet&#39;s main routing protocol, rather than a hijack. Each Internet Service Provider advertises to all others a list of Internet Protocols it owns. A prefix leak occurs when an ISP advertises a range of IPs it does not own, according to the Google spokesperson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BGP is a decades&#39; old technology that is not cryptographically secure, enabling these types of mistakes by third parties, which is what this incident most likely was, said Rick Moy, chief marketing officer at<a href=\"http://www.acalvio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Acalvio</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;There have certainly been nefarious BGP hijackings in the past, and I am sure they will continue because they enable traffic hijacking and even cryptojacking,&quot; he told TechNewsWorld. &quot;Also, unfortunately, there is no quick fix.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These types of issues are typically due to hacking, rather than a mistake that was made, noted Chris Rivers, vice president of Web development at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mghus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MGH</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in this case, the incident seems to have been caused by an error that occurred during planned network maintenance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It is interesting that the traffic was rerouted to countries already known for &#39;big brother&#39; uses of technology to spy on citizens,&quot; Rivers told TechNewsWorld. &quot;There was definitely a vulnerability via mistake that Google is denying.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the bigger picture, this type of situation caused a massive denial of service to the G Suite. Attacking a vulnerability like this would be designed to disrupt service to its intended audience, he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>No Harm, No Foul?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, Google claims that a Nigerian ISP caused the problem with no malicious intent. This issue only affected network traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since nearly all Internet traffic to Google services is encrypted, there was no increased risk of data exposure as a result of this leak, according to Google.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google maintains that nothing indicates this was an attack or a breach. Google&#39;s internal analysis is consistent with Mainone&#39;s claim that the situation was caused by a misconfiguration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Given the time to resolve this issue, it is highly likely that this was an honest mistake by a core Internet provider,&quot; said Brian Chappell, senior director for enterprise and solutions architecture at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.beyondtrust.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BeyondTrust</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The mechanisms for managing the routing of traffic across the Internet have been an area of concern for some time, as there is no real authentication for the information. It is a trust-based approach,&quot; he told TechNewsWorld.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of an intentional attack or mistake, the implications can range from denial of service and slow response of service to the compromise of data in transit, said BeyondTrust CTO Morey Haber. If there had been an intention to target an ISP, this could have been a serious incident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While [data compromise] is much less likely due to all Google traffic being encrypted, there are scenarios from man-in-the-middle attacks to compromised keys that could be utilized in a blended attack to decrypt the traffic,&quot; Haber told TechNewsWorld.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Comes Next?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Viewed as an accident, this incident will drive attention and activity toward a more robust solution, suggested Chappell. The organization responsible for the mistake very likely will implement more stringent processes to avoid such an event happening again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Assuming that the systems in question are accessed through a secure solution, such as a privileged password management solution, it is likely there were session recordings that could be searched to find the event and allow for rapid remediation,&quot; he said. &quot;If not, that is definitely the first step that organizations should be taking.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Viewed as a malicious action, it highlights the inherent insecurity of routing protocols. While core providers are likely to have significant controls around the manipulation of protocols and tables within their organization, that does not eliminate the possibility of malfeasance by internal and external parties. Either way, we can expect to see renewed activity in this space, according to Chappell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether accidental or deliberate, there are implications that need fixing, noted Haber. The rerouting of traffic out of a geographic region due to pure ISP hygiene is unacceptable. If it had occurred in other regions -- like Europe, the Middle East and Africa -- it could have been perceived as an EU General Data Protection Regulation violation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Attack or Accident: Same Impact</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of attack or accident can have real financial impact for companies doing business online, warned Chappell. Being able to redirect traffic away from legitimate sites, either to interrupt services or worse, to present fake sites, undoubtedly would lead to immediate financial and secondary reputational loss for organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;While it didn&#39;t actually stop [Google&#39;s] platform working, it may have impacted many sites which rely on their services. The final tally will become apparent in time,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of incident is a reminder of the dependencies all cloud users face. Entities in far regions of the world can affect traffic and cause an outage in services users rely on every day, added Haber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Businesses operating online need to be reminded that their dependencies on cloud services should have contractual requirements in the form of SLAs,&quot; he said, &quot;and that operational backup plans should be developed in case incidents like this materialize as full-blown attacks.&quot;</p>\r\n', 2, 12),

Smart fridges will be capable of ordering groceries when we&#39;re running low, for example, and smart desks will alert us when we&#39;ve been sitting too long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there is vast opportunity for IoT to improve both our personal and professional lives, there&#39;s an equally vast opportunity for bad actors to exploit vulnerabilities in connected devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of us, without thinking twice, assume that privileged access and configurations around our current IoT devices will stay the same; however, failing to acknowledge or scan for new developments could be a fatal mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overlooking new security measures that would further improve security for IoT devices could result in exposure to malicious attackers and the growing cybersecurity threat landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the world of manufacturing -- where shaping up and shipping out the next best product as fast as possible is the name of the game -- security is commonly, and disturbingly, an afterthought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Unsecure Is Your IoT Device?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest security concerns, when it comes to IoT devices, is unauthorized access. Unbeknownst to the everyday user, each device can act as an entry point into a network. Leaving them unsecured could create a large and unmanageable attack surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mirai botnet malware attack, which struck two years ago, showed just how high IoT risk really is. To carry out the attack, hackers gained access to millions of routers and IP cameras through hardcoded default passwords, like admin/password or root/1234.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They then created a botnet leveraging the hijacked cameras to conduct a coordinated DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack that rendered much of the Internet inaccessible on the United States&#39; East Coast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, VPNFilter malware targeted IoT devices, infecting SOHO (small-office-home-office) routers through well-known software vulnerabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The malware hijacked network flows going through the routers and featured a kill-switch capable of destroying the routers&#39; software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Who cares about SOHO routers?&quot; you might ask. Well, these devices are used by critical infrastructure, such as the energy sector. Imagine the impact this kind of malware could have on the U.S. if it could shut down energy grids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What would transpire if IoT-connected vehicles, such as smart cars, were the victims of an attack? Imagine hackers taking control of the wheel to steer a car off the road or remotely steal a vehicle from its owner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The potential ramifications of compromised IoT devices could be detrimental to both our online and physical safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As these examples show, IoT devices have the potential to create a high-risk security environment capable of widespread, crippling damage -- not to mention a complete headache for security executives and their teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Managing Your IoT Devices Like Employees</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how do security professionals safeguard their business from IoT cyber risks? They should start by treating each IoT device connected to their network as an employee, by incorporating them into existing identity management processes and applying the following best practices:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote><strong>1. Give devices an identity:</strong>&nbsp;To achieve this, you must first embrace a different mindset. View IoT devices not as pieces of technology, but rather as privileged users who have access to sensitive information. By assigning a device and identity and provisioning them appropriately, their activity can be monitored and managed throughout their whole life cycle on the network.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Apply device governance:</strong>&nbsp;Once each device is given an identity, you should apply policy-based authentication and access control. It&#39;s easy to deploy an IoT device and forget about it, but the reality is that these devices are a conduit between the internet and your environment, making them an easy attack vector for unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive corporate information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Device authentication and access should be governed and routinely revisited during the full device lifecycle -- through software updates, bug fixes, new firmware, routine maintenance and diagnostic improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Employ the principle of least privilege:</strong>&nbsp;Just as you would only give an employee the minimum access to data and systems they need to do their jobs, businesses need to limit the access of their IoT devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employ firewalls and permissions to safeguard against unauthorized devices obtaining proprietary or privileged information. For example, your smart printer doesn&#39;t need access to the CFO&#39;s income statements folder. The less access you give an IoT device, or employee, the less damage either could bring to the enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Manage device passwords:</strong>&nbsp;Similar to users, IoT devices contain passwords that grant them authentication to systems, files and data. Best practices for managing user passwords -- such as requiring routine resets and multifactor -- also apply to IoT passwords. These passwords must be updated routinely and closely managed to protect the vital information they store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Monitor the device:</strong>&nbsp;Devices should be monitored 24x7 to identify unusual activity, check for necessary patch updates, and confirm each device is still in the right network segment. Machines are highly predictable, and abnormal behavior can be a clear giveaway if there is an unauthorized user controlling the device. Without the right monitoring processes in place, these abnormalities -- and thereby potential malicious actors -- can go undetected.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Managing IoT devices as employees, as part of your identity and access management processes, is the best way to ensure any access is kept in check and potential threats or anomalies are monitored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although there can be thousands of IoT devices connected to a network at once, it takes only one poorly managed machine to inadvertently breach an organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As more of these devices join the network, businesses that employ these best practices can work to eliminate IoT as a threat, and begin to realize the productivity potential it was designed to bring them in the first place.</p>\r\n', 2, 5),
(50, 15, 'Mobile Phone Security: All You Need to Know', 'e2e6906f51.jpg', '2018-11-16', '<p>We rely on our phones to process and store reams of personal digital data. Our digital activities -- from checking bank balances to paying for a product with a tap of the screen, to sending friends and family messages over social media, to accessing work emails remotely -- have turned our phones into a goldmine of personal information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s likely that by 2020, there will be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sophos.com/de-de/security-news-trends/security-trends/malware-goes-mobile.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">more than 6 billion smartphone users in the world</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How secure is your mobile device? It&#39;s easy to forget that your mobile phone is essentially a pocket-sized computer and that, just as with any device that can connect to the Internet, mobile phones are at risk of a cyberattack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is that mobile malware is still relatively uncommon, with the total rate of infections standing at 8 percent. Mobile malware is outnumbered by PC attacks 40-1, as mobiles operate on far more customized systems, and malware must be tailored to a specific system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, mobile malware has been increasing at an alarming rate. There was a<a href=\"https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/consumer/consumer-threat-notices/consumer-trends-mcafee-labs-threats-report-sept-2018/\" target=\"_blank\">27 percent increase in new mobile malware</a>&nbsp;in the last quarter of 2017, according to McAfee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Securing your mobile phone should be a top priority, both for personal and business use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Types of Mobile Malware</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The types of mobile malware users may be exposed to are many and varying. Following are some examples:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Mobile spyware:</strong>&nbsp;This form of malicious software can infiltrate seemingly benign programs and secretly monitor your activity, record your location, and steal sensitive passwords. You may even have inadvertently granted an app access to harvest this information when you downloaded it.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Rooting malware:</strong>&nbsp;A particularly unsavory form of malware, these bugs gain root access to a compromised device in order to provide hackers with administrative privileges and access to users&#39; files. Some rooting malware, such as Ztorg, are able to embed themselves into the system folders, so that even a factory reset won&#39;t be able to remove them.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Mobile banking Trojans:</strong>&nbsp;As mobile banking grows in popularity, an increasingly grave problem in the cybersecurity world is mobile banking viruses. In 2017, mobile banking Trojans&nbsp;<a href=\"https://securelist.com/mobile-malware-review-2017/84139/#types-of-mobile-malware\" target=\"_blank\">attacked close to 260,000 users across 164 countries</a>. Attackers masquerade as a legitimate banking app to lure users into installing it, only to steal their credentials.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>SMS malware:</strong>&nbsp;This form of malware will manipulate a mobile phone to send premium-rate text messages, often without the user noticing until they receive a shocking bill at the end of the month.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Your Mobile Phone Can Get Infected</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>By far the most common way that your device may become infected is if you download a malicious app. Cybercriminals may pirate an existing app and list it on a third-party app store with hidden malware attached, so that users who download the app invite malicious software onto their devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hackers also exploit known vulnerabilities in an operating system, which is why it is paramount that you keep your device up-to-date with the latest software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old-school method of sending a virus via fake emails can pose a threat to mobile phones as well, and this extends to suspicious texts. If you click a link on a fraudulent email or text, it probably will send you to a dummy site and automatically download malware onto your device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way you might expose yourself to an attack is by connecting to a public WiFi hotspot. As public WiFi is usually unencrypted, attackers can intercept the data stream between the user and the access point. Known as a &quot;man-in-the-middle attack,&quot; this can enable intruders to eavesdrop on any conversations carried out over the compromised network.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Android vs. iOS</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Google&#39;s Android is the main target for malware, with a reported&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.f-secure.com/another-reason-99-percent-of-mobile-malware-targets-androids/\" target=\"_blank\">19 million malware programs developed especially for Android</a>. The reason for this is three-fold: Android&#39;s dominance of the global smartphone market; the inconsistency of updates to the Android operating system; and its relatively open system for the distribution of apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>More Android phones to attack</strong>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Although the Apple logo may have become ubiquitous over the years, 85 percent of smartphone users worldwide have an Android phone. Big name brands such as Samsung, Huawei and HTC all run on Google&#39;s Android OS.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Frequency of OS updates</strong>\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Android&#39;s updates are more fragmented. When Google releases an update to Android, it takes some time for consumers to receive it, unless they have a Google branded device, such as a Pixel.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Non-Google Android devices, however, are customized with different apps and services, depending on the device manufacturer and network carrier behind the phone. Each customized version rolls out Android updates at a different rate.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Openness of platform</strong>\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Android has a more open and adaptable platform that renders it more vulnerable to cyberattacks than the Apple iOS. Users can download apps from third-party sources, which are not regulated by Google Play.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>This is how the majority of the 10 million Android devices became infected by the Adware Hummingbad in 2016, although a variant of the malware subsequently was discovered on 20 apps in Google&#39;s official Play Store.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The so-called &quot;walled garden&quot; of Apple&#39;s App Store, on the other hand, means that all iPhone apps are heavily vetted by Apple before they can be listed in this centralized point of distribution.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>iOS Weaknesses</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, Apple&#39;s iOS is not entirely failsafe. The large-scale XCodeGhost attack that occurred in China in 2015 compromised more than 39 apps, including older versions of the popular WeChat app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hackers had infiltrated the App Store by offering a counterfeit version of Apple&#39;s XCode software to developers. They then were able to steal data and send fake alerts to compromised devices to trick users into revealing their information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jailbroken iPhones, in particular, are at risk of a malware attack, because they circumvent the security restrictions imposed by the App store. Users may wish to jailbreak their phones in order to gain access to free apps or those that are not available on the App Store. However, this opens them up to significant risks, and users may find they have accidentally downloaded a dangerous app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The KeyRaider hack of 2015, for instance, compromised more than 225,000 Apple accounts by targeting jailbroken iPhones and iPads.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Are the Signs of a Malware Attack on Your Phone?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you contract a virus on your computer, it can be quite straightforward to spot that something has gone wrong. You&#39;ll probably see hundreds of irritating pop-ups or find that your computer starts to randomly and sporadically crash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The signs of an infection on your mobile phone, however, may be harder to spot. You may have some malware lurking in the background and corrupting your phone without even realizing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key signs to look for are if your device suddenly begins to operate more slowly, or your battery drains more rapidly than usual. Far more than an indication that you need a phone upgrade, a noticeable and sudden drop in performance could be a sign of an infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another tell-tale sign to assess whether you may have a virus on your phone is if you see sudden spikes in your data usage. This could be a result of a virus running background tasks that you aren&#39;t aware of, or trying to access the Internet in order to transmit data from your phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strange charges on your monthly bill also could be symptomatic of a virus, as some malware can make money from sending premium texts from your phone without you noticing. Be sure to review your bill routinely so you can catch any dangerous viruses early.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to Remove Mobile Malware</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you suspect that your phone may have been compromised, what steps can you take to remove malicious software?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s first consider how to remove mobile malware from an Android phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to start by putting your phone into Safe Mode. You can do this by holding down the power off button until you&#39;re prompted to reboot your device to Safe Mode. The Safe Mode will disable all third-party apps, so if you find that your device then works smoothly, you can be confident that a virus is at the root of your problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then go into your settings and to the apps folder. Scan for the app that you think might be the culprit, or for anything that you don&#39;t recall downloading. You can remove it manually by clicking the uninstall button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Top Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes the uninstall button will be gray and won&#39;t respond when you tap on it, because the malicious app has granted itself administrator status. In that case, you need to go into the security settings and deactivate administrator rights for the malicious app in question. You then should be able to remove the app from the app list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are still unable to remove the malicious software from your device, you will need to do a full factory reset. This can be achieved by going into your phone settings and erasing all data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sure that you have backed up any important files before you do this, as you will not be able to retrieve your beloved photos and important contact list afterward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do you remove a virus from an iPhone?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As explained above, iOS malware is far rarer than Android malware, but attacks are still possible. Respectable apps may have had malicious code inserted in them by a hacker. Users who have jailbroken their phones may have inadvertently downloaded a malicious app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is that iOS&#39; sandboxing structure, which restricts every app&#39;s access, prevents any malware from spreading to and corrupting other apps or the underlying operating system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that it is quite simple to see which is the compromised app causing your phone to malfunction. You&#39;ll only have problems when the app in question is open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, see if there is a newer version of the app in the App Store, as the problem may have been identified and resolved in a new update. If not, you will need to outright remove the app from your device by uninstalling it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the virus is manifesting itself as a redirect to a spammy Web page, you&#39;ll also want to clear your Safari history and data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tips for Securing Your Mobile Phone</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the most effective way to protect your phone from malware is to take preventative steps to reduce the likelihood of contracting an infection in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following are our top tips for securing your mobile phone:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Be wary of public WiFi hotspots</strong>\r\n\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Do not access any sensitive information through public WiFi, such as logging into your bank or checking sensitive work emails, as a hacker may be able to intercept your communication through a &quot;man-in-the-middle&quot; attack. It is far more secure to use a 3G or 4G instead, or to use a VPN.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Do not jailbreak or root your device</strong>\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>It may sound appealing to be able to download paid apps for free by jailbreaking your iPhone or rooting your Android, but this removes the protection from Apple and Google respectively. Proceed with caution if you do go down this route, or you may find yourself vulnerable to malicious apps.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Only download apps from the official app stores</strong>\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Savvy hackers have been known to slip past the walled garden of the App Store and the security measures of Google Play Protect, but your chances of downloading a malicious app are far lower if you stick to the official app stores.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Update your operating system</strong>\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems to gain access to outdated smartphones. Be sure to install updates to your software as soon as a new version is released, to minimize this risk.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Encrypt your device</strong>\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Encrypting your phone will scramble all files so that only you have access to them. You&#39;ll need to enter a PIN or password to decrypt your phone every time you want to use it.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Review your access permissions</strong>\r\n	<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Often when consumers download new apps they don&#39;t take the time to read the Terms &amp; Conditions, or consider what data they are allowing the app to access.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>In some cases, it may be useful to allow an app to access your location, such as a transport or weather app. But does the app need to know your location even when you&#39;re not using it? Review your app permissions in your privacy settings, and disable any consents that don&#39;t seem essential.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope that you found this article on mobile phone security useful -- and that you now know that protecting your device involves far more than just sticking a screen protector and case on it!</p>\r\n', 1, 16);
